# jest-aliasify-resolver

This extension allows you to use aliasify transform with the `Jest` testing framework.

# Installation
Install with `npm install --save-dev jest-aliasify-resolver`

# Usage
After adding your aliases to either your package.json or to an `aliasify` config file, change the following field on your `jest` config file to

    {
        ...
        "resolver": "jest-aliasify-resolver",
        ...
    }
    
Or if you're using `gulp-jest`, don't forget to pass the resolver into the config object

    ...
    return gulp.src(<path>).pipe(jest({
        config: {
            ...
            resolver: "jest-aliasify-resolver",
            ...
        }
    }));
    ...


And _voil√°_! Now your custom imports should resolve according to the aliases you have set up.
